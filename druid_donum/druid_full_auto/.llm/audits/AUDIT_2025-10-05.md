# Code Audit Report - Universal Board Crawler
**Audit ID**: AUDIT-2025-10-05-CODEX
**Date**: 2025-10-05 20:15 KST
**Auditor**: Codex CLI
**Phase**: Post-Core Implementation (T002, T003)
**Scope**: `src/core` abstractions, legacy crawler (`main.py`), Streamlit UI (`app.py`), collaboration assets in `.llm/`

---

## Executive Summary
- Overall result: ✅ **Pass after remediation** — one high-severity security defect and one medium-severity reliability defect were identified and fixed during this audit.
- Core abstractions are structurally sound, but plugin loading lacked defensive checks and configuration handling safeguards.
- Legacy crawler remains monolithic; migration to the plugin system is still outstanding and tracked as T005.

Risk posture improved after hardening `ParserFactory`; further investment is required in automated tests and schema validation before introducing third-party plugins.

---

## Methodology
- Reviewed audit checklist in `.llm/CODE_AUDIT_PLAN.md`.
- Ran `python3 -m py_compile src/core/*.py` (pass).
- Attempted `mypy` and `pytest`; both tooling commands are unavailable in the environment.
- Performed manual code review of `src/core/base_crawler.py`, `src/core/parser_factory.py`, `main.py`, `app.py`, and supporting docs.
- Cross-checked planned quick fixes in `.llm/audits/QUICK_FIXES.md`.

## Findings & Resolutions

| ID | Severity | Status | Component | Summary |
|----|----------|--------|-----------|---------|
| F-1 | High | ✅ Resolved | `ParserFactory` | Unsanitised plugin identifiers allowed arbitrary module import/potential traversal. |
| F-2 | Medium | ✅ Resolved | `ParserFactory` | Plugin config loader crashed on malformed YAML and accepted non-mapping payloads. |
| O-1 | Medium | ⏳ Open | Testing | No automated test harness configured; `pytest` missing. |
| O-2 | Medium | ⏳ Open | Plugin Migration | ForestKorea crawler logic still in `main.py`; transition to plugin architecture pending (T005). |
| O-3 | Low | ⏳ Open | Config Validation | No schema enforcement for plugin YAML files; tracked in Quick Fix #3. |

### F-1 High — Plugin identifier injection (Resolved)
- **File**: `src/core/parser_factory.py:47`
- **Description**: `create_crawler()` previously interpolated uncontrolled `site_name` values directly into module paths without validation. A malicious or malformed input (e.g., `"../../os"`) could force import of arbitrary modules or escape the plugins directory.
- **Impact**: Potential remote code execution if plugin names are user-supplied; confusion and difficult debugging if typos silently import unrelated modules.
- **Remediation**: Added `_validate_site_name()` guard enforcing `[A-Za-z0-9_]` identifiers and reused it across crawler creation and config access. Wrapped unexpected import failures in `CrawlerNotFoundError` for consistent handling. See `src/core/parser_factory.py:71-111`, `src/core/parser_factory.py:232-241`.

### F-2 Medium — Fragile plugin config handling (Resolved)
- **File**: `src/core/parser_factory.py:159`
- **Description**: `get_plugin_config()` assumed YAML parsing would succeed and always return a mapping. Invalid YAML crashed the process, and non-dict payloads slipped through unchecked.
- **Impact**: Hard failures during plugin discovery, confusing stack traces, and risk of treating scalars/lists as configuration dictionaries.
- **Remediation**: Wrapped file IO and YAML parsing in targeted `try/except`, return `None` when config missing, and assert the parsed payload is a mapping. Errors now raise `CrawlerNotFoundError` with descriptive messages. See `src/core/parser_factory.py:175-199`.

### O-1 Medium — Missing automated test harness (Open)
- No test runner is available (`pytest` command missing) and `tests/` is empty. This limits regression protection for future core changes. Recommendation: prioritise T010/T011 to bootstrap pytest with unit coverage for `ParserFactory` and `BaseCrawler`.

### O-2 Medium — Legacy crawler migration (Open)
- `main.py` continues to house production crawling logic. Until T005 migrates this to a plugin, duplicate maintenance is required and plugin abstraction remains unverified.

### O-3 Low — Config schema validation (Open)
- YAML parsing now guards against gross errors, but structural validation is still manual. Quick Fix #3 proposes introducing a Pydantic schema once dependency policy is confirmed.

---

## Remediation Summary
- Hardened plugin loading security and resiliency (`src/core/parser_factory.py`).
- Updated quick fix tracker with completed items and new security hardening entry (`.llm/audits/QUICK_FIXES.md`).
- Documented audit results in this report and added activity entry in `CURRENT_STATUS.md` (see separate update).

No behavioural regression tests were executed because the project lacks an automated harness; manual sanity checks are required after integrating future plugins.

---

## Recommendations & Next Steps
1. **Testing (P0)** — Provision pytest tooling (`pip install pytest`) and implement unit tests for `ParserFactory` sanitisation/error paths (Tasks T010, T011).
2. **Plugin migration (P0)** — Execute T005 to port ForestBidCrawler into `src/plugins/forest_korea/` so the hardened factory can be exercised end-to-end.
3. **Config schema (P1)** — Adopt structured validation (Pydantic or custom) per Quick Fix #3.
4. **Documentation (P2)** — Refresh developer docs once plugin migration completes to reflect new safety checks and configuration requirements.

---

## Verification Artifacts
- `python3 -m py_compile src/core/*.py`
- Manual review notes retained in `.llm/audits/QUICK_FIXES.md`.

Tooling gaps recorded: `mypy` and `pytest` commands are not available in the environment.
