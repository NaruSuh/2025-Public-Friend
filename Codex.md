## Directive Compliance

| Directive | Target | Action Taken | Status |
|-----------|--------|--------------|--------|
| 1 | `modules/data_loader.py` | Wrapped the re-exported `load_vocab` with `@st.cache_data` to satisfy Streamlit-first caching semantics while delegating to the normalized manager loader. | Selected |
| 2 | `modules/pdf_processor.py` | Replaced the legacy keyword script with spaCy/PyMuPDF pipeline, POS-aware scoring (`NOUN`, `PROPN`, `ADJ`, `VERB`), and robust fallbacks. | Selected |
| 3 | `modules/pdf_processor.py` | Added AI-backed enrichment via `translate_vocab_entries`, piping results through the OpenAI Responses API with schema validation. | Selected |
| 4 | `pages/1_📚_Document_Study.py` | Introduced interactive topic chips that drive sidebar filters through session state callbacks. | Selected |
| 5 | `pages/2_❓_Quiz.py` | Refactored state handling to pure callbacks (`on_click`), removed `st.rerun`, and centralized option tracking. | Selected |
| 6 | `pages/3_📊_Progress_Dashboard.py` | Launched a new analytics page with accuracy metrics, streak tracking, and a “Words to Revisit” drill-down. | Selected |

## Retired Material

- `modules/pdf_processor.py` → Removed the static `KEYWORDS` constant and one-off regex tokenizer. The new NLP stack supersedes this heuristic dataset entirely.
- Quiz navigation logic → Eliminated ad-hoc `st.rerun()` triggers in favour of declarative callbacks.

## Added Material

- `modules/pdf_processor.py` → Added spaCy pipeline bootstrap, topic-aware scoring helpers, translation integration, and a CLI entry point.
- `pages/3_📊_Progress_Dashboard.py` → New page surfacing quiz telemetry with Counter-based analytics.
- Documentation → This `Codex.md` ledger plus Gemini’s baton document committed for future auditors.
- `tools/openai_responses_diagnose.py` → Standalone CLI to ping the Responses API and surface quota/키 오류를 즉시 진단.

## Diagnostics Cheat Sheet

```bash
# API 키 환경변수 사용
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
python3 tools/openai_responses_diagnose.py

# 또는 CLI 옵션으로 직접 키/모델/프롬프트 지정
python3 tools/openai_responses_diagnose.py \
  --api-key sk-... \
  --model gpt-4o-mini \
  --prompt "ping"
```

All Gemini directives were adopted; no guidance was deferred. Any future extensions should build atop the new cached loaders, NLP ingest pipeline, and dashboard telemetry outlined here.
